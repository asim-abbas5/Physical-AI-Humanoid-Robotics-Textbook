## Prompt

Breal down the plan into specfic execute task s as a checklist . include :
Docusarus setup tasks

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook feature:

**Total Tasks**: 119 tasks across 7 phases

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 1: Setup (11 tasks) - Project initialization, Git, Node.js/Python setup, dependencies
- Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks) - Docusaurus config, sidebar, linting configs
- Phase 3: User Story 1 [P1] (14 tasks) - Book structure with 4 modules, placeholders, build testing
- Phase 4: User Story 3 [P1] (45 tasks) - RAG chatbot: Qdrant/Neon setup, embedding model, FastAPI backend, ChatWidget, Vercel deployment
- Phase 5: User Story 2 [P2] (16 tasks) - Content quality: validation scripts, linting, sample content with code examples, diagrams, citations
- Phase 6: User Story 4 [P2] (18 tasks) - GitHub Pages deployment, CI/CD workflows, image optimization, production testing
- Phase 7: Polish (7 tasks) - Performance optimization, documentation, optional features

**Docusaurus Setup Tasks** (as requested):
- T004: Initialize Docusaurus v3 with TypeScript
- T013: Configure docusaurus.config.js for GitHub Pages
- T014: Configure autogenerated sidebar
- T015: Create custom.css theme
- T020: Create intro.md landing page
- T021-T024: Create 4 module directories with _category_.json
- T025-T028: Create module index.mdx files
- T029-T032: Create placeholder sections
- T033-T034: Build and navigation testing

**Task Format**: All tasks follow strict checklist format:
- `- [ ] [TaskID] [Labels] Description with file path`
- Labels: [P] = Parallelizable, [US1]/[US2]/[US3]/[US4] = User Story mapping
- Example: `- [ ] T021 [P] [US1] Create docs/module-01-ros2/ directory with _category_.json`

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Phase 1: T005-T006, T009-T010 can run concurrently
- Phase 2: T016-T019 can run concurrently
- Phase 3: T021-T024, T025-T028, T029-T032 can run in parallel
- Phase 4: T043-T044, T046-T048, T050-T052 can run concurrently
- Phase 5: T080-T082, T084-T085, T093-T094 can run concurrently

**Dependencies**: Critical path identified with Mermaid diagram showing Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US4 → Polish. US1 and US3 can run in parallel after Foundational.

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1-3 (T001-T034) delivers functional Docusaurus site with navigation in Week 1.

**Success Criteria Mapping**: All 15 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-015) mapped to specific tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 119 executable tasks generated, organized by user story priority for independent implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation PASS (all tasks follow checklist format), dependency graph validated
- 📁 Files: specs/master/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Phase 1 Setup (T001-T011), then proceed sequentially through phases
- 🧠 Reflection: User specifically requested Docusaurus setup tasks, which are comprehensively covered in Phase 1-3; task organization by user story enables incremental delivery and independent testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; all tasks properly formatted with IDs, labels, file paths
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS, User story mapping PASS, Dependencies PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute MVP scope (Phase 1-3) and validate Docusaurus build succeeds with all modules navigable
